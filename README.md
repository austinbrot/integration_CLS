# Integration of New Information in Memory: New Insights from a Complementary Learning Systems Perspectiv

This repository contains code for deriving the results in our paper on Integration of New Information in Memory.

This code was written by James L. McClelland, except for the material for part 1 of the supplement, contained in the (supplement_part_1/) folder, which was written by Andrew K. Lampinen. Questions about the code should be directed accordingly.

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with:

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) 4.4.0
    -- with Python 2.7 kernel.
- [tensorflow-gpu](ihttps://www.tensorflow.org/) version 1.4.0
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) version 2.1.1
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) version 1.13.3
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/) version 1.0.0

Much newer versions of any library may cause errors due to non-backwards-compatible changes in e.g. tensorflow.
